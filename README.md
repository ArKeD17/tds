# Tds

MSSQL / TDS Database driver for Elixir.

This is an alpha version that currently supports Ecto 2.0. It has implemented the [db_connection](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/db_connection) behaviour, and added support for transactions and prepared queries.
Please check out the issues for a more complete overview. This branch should not yet be considered stable or used in production.

## Usage

Add Tds as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:tds, "~> 1.0.4"} ]
end
```

After you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile Tds. Start an interactive Elixir shell with `iex -S mix`.

```iex
iex> {:ok, pid} = Tds.start_link([hostname: "localhost", username: "test_user", password: "test_password", database: "test_db", port: 4000])
{:ok, #PID<0.69.0>}
iex> Tds.query!(pid, "SELECT 'Some Awesome Text' AS MyColumn", [])
%Tds.Result{columns: ["MyColumn"], rows: [{"Some Awesome Text"}], num_rows: 1}}
iex> Tds.query!(pid, "INSERT INTO MyTable (MyColumn) VALUES (@my_value)", [%Tds.Parameter{name: "@my_value", value: "My Actual Value"}])
%Tds.Result{columns: nil, rows: nil, num_rows: 1}}
```

## Features

  * Automatic decoding and encoding of Elixir values to and from MSSQL's binary format
  * Supports TDS Version 7.3, 7.4

## Connecting to SQL Instances
Tds Supports sql instances by passing ```instance: "instancename"``` to the connection options.



## Data representation

    TDS             Elixir
    ----------      ------
    NULL            nil
    bool            true | false
    char            "Ã©"
    int             42
    float           42.0
    text            "text"
    binary          <<42>>
    numeric         #Decimal<42.0> *
    date            {2013, 10, 12}
    time            {0, 37, 14}
    datetime	      {{2013, 10, 12}, {0, 37, 14}}
    uuid            <<160,238,188,153,156,11,78,248,187,109,107,185,189,56,10,17>>

All data types will be supported, unsupported types currently are *User Defined Types*, xml

## Contributing

To contribute you need to compile Tds from source and test it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/livehelpnow/tds.git
$ cd tds
$ mix test
```

The tests require your sql server database to be present on localhost. In case you are unable to run local instance of SQL server either using local installation on [windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup) or [linix](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup), docker image for [linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/) 


Additionally SQL authentication needs to be used for connecting and testing. Check config/test.exs file for credentials used in unit testing.
